Welcome to my blog! This is my first post using MDX and created entirely with [Cursor](https://cursor.sh), an AI-powered code editor that makes development a breeze. MDX is a powerful format that allows you to use JSX in your Markdown content.

## Features

- Created with Cursor AI
- Write content in Markdown
- Use React components
- Style with Tailwind CSS
- Support for code blocks

```typescript
const greeting = 'Hello, World!';
console.log(greeting);
```

## Why Cursor?

I chose Cursor as my primary code editor because:

1. Agent Mode for natural coding conversations
2. Seamless chat interface
3. Smart code completions
4. Efficient code navigation
5. Beautiful, distraction-free interface

## What's Next?

I'll be sharing more posts about:

1. Web Development
2. Design
3. Technology
4. AI and Development
5. And much more!

Stay tuned for more content! ðŸš€
